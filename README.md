Certainly! The part of the code `= () => {}` is an arrow function expression in JavaScript. It's a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript and is particularly useful for inline functions and callbacks. Here's a breakdown of the syntax:

- `=`: This is the assignment operator, which is used to assign the function expression to a variable.
- `()`: These parentheses are used to define the parameters of the function. Since there are no parameters in this case, the parentheses are empty.
- `=>`: This is the arrow token that defines the function as an arrow function.
- `{}`: These curly braces contain the body of the function. Since there's nothing inside the braces in this example, the function doesn't perform any actions or return any values.

So, `= () => {}` means you are assigning an arrow function that takes no parameters and has an empty body to a variable. If this function were to be used, you would likely add parameters within the parentheses and code within the curly braces to perform the desired actions.

Arrow functions have a few differences from traditional function expressions:
- They do not have their own `this` context, instead, they inherit `this` from the parent scope at the time they are defined.
- They cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error if used with the `new` keyword.
- They do not have a `prototype` property.
- They cannot use the `yield` keyword within their body, hence they cannot be used as generator functions.

Would you like to see an example of how an arrow function is used in a more complete code context?

Sure, I can help with that! Here is a PostgreSQL statement to create a table for storing directory information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE directory_info (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    path TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_time_indexed TIMESTAMP,
    directory_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    hidden BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    system_status BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

This statement creates a table named `directory_info` with the following columns:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each record.
- `path`: The directory path.
- `last_time_indexed`: The timestamp of the last time the directory was indexed.
- `directory_name`: The name of the directory.
- `hidden`: A boolean indicating if the directory is hidden.
- `system_status`: A boolean indicating if the directory is a system directory.

Let me know if you need any modifications or additional details!

Count number of different file types:
```sql
SELECT file_extension, COUNT(*) AS extension_count
FROM file_info
GROUP BY file_extension
ORDER BY extension_count DESC;
```
